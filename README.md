## Python implementation of the Paladins and Smite APIs

I have created python equivalent of functions offered by Hi Rez paladins and smite API. GitHub cannot render the jupyter notebook correctly, please make sure to read the python file if facing any errors

## Next steps:

* [ ] Complete code for all functions
* [ ] Write function for choosing Xbox, PS4 and PC
* [ ] Extract and build database for top players and teams
* [ ] Parse data into csv to be used in R for analysis and visualization
